1. Fiber Optic Cable:

 Fiber Optic Cable is also known as the Optical Fiber Cable. It is made up of plastic or glass. It transmits signals in the form of light. There are 3 basic components of the optical transmission system which are as follows:

    Light source
    Transmission media (fiber optics)
    Detector

Advantages of Fiber optic cables:

    High bandwidth: Fiber optic cables have a much higher bandwidth than copper wires, which means they can carry more data at faster speeds.
    Long distance: Fiber optic cables can transmit data over long distances without signal loss or degradation. This makes them ideal for long-haul communication.
    Immunity to electromagnetic interference: Fiber optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can be a significant problem for copper wires.
    Security: Fiber optic cables are much more difficult to tap into or intercept than copper wires, making them more secure for sensitive data transmission.

Disadvantages of Fiber optic cables:

    Cost: Fiber optic cables are generally more expensive than copper wires, which can be a significant factor in some applications.
    Fragility: Fiber optic cables are more fragile than copper wires and can be damaged easily if not handled carefully.
    Limited compatibility: Fiber optic cables are not always compatible with older network equipment and may require costly upgrades.

2. Copper wire: 

Copper wire is used for the electrical wiring. It transmits data in the form of electronic signals. It is the single solid conductor. 

Advantages of Copper wires:

    Low cost: Copper wires are generally less expensive than fiber optic cables, which can make them more cost-effective for some applications.
    Easy to install: Copper wires are easy to install and work with, which can make them a more convenient choice for some applications.
    Compatibility: Copper wires are compatible with a wide range of network equipment, making them a versatile choice.
    Durability: Copper wires are more durable than fiber optic cables and can withstand more physical abuse.

Disadvantages of Copper wires:

    Limited bandwidth: Copper wires have a lower bandwidth than fiber optic cables, which means they can carry less data at slower speeds.
    Signal loss: Copper wires are more susceptible to signal loss and degradation over long distances, which can limit their usefulness in certain applications.
    Electromagnetic interference: Copper wires are susceptible to electromagnetic interference, which can cause signal distortion and other problems.
    Security: Copper wires are more vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping than fiber optic cables.
